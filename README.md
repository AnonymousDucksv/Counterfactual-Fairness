# Counterfactual-Fairness
# the data_load.py file contains:
# (1) Information on preprocessing of datasets mentioned in the Survey on Datasets for Fairness Aware Machine Learning [1].
# (2) Functions required to run the CARLA framework for multiple CE generation algorithms
# (3) Parameters and functions required to run the MACE algorithm
# Some of the functions and preprocessing steps are inspired by Karimi et al. [2]
