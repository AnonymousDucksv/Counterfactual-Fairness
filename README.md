# Counterfactual-Fairness
the data_load.py file contains: <br />
(1) Information on preprocessing of datasets mentioned in the Survey on Datasets for Fairness Aware Machine Learning [1]. <br />
(2) Functions required to run the CARLA framework for multiple CE generation algorithms <br />
(3) Parameters and functions required to run the MACE algorithm <br />
Some of the functions and preprocessing steps are inspired by Karimi et al. [2] <br />
